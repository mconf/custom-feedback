# Customizable BigBlueButton feedback form

This project offers a customizable feedback solution that can be easily integrated into any other application via a redirect URL. It consists of an intuitive user interface (front-end) and an HTTP server (back-end) that handles webhooks to collect meeting and user data.

Compatible with Bigbluebutton >= 3.0

    Package coming soon

## Project Structure

### Front-end

The front-end is responsible for the entire user interface. It allows users to interact with the feedback system in a user-friendly and efficient manner.

Additional feedback options can be added or existing options can be modified via the feedbackData.json file. This file is mapped to render the feedback options and steps, and is served as a static asset so it can be overridden per deployment (see [Customizing the feedback form](#customizing-the-feedback-form)).

### Back-end

The back-end is an HTTP server that listens for webhooks and collects data on meetings and users. This data is processed and stored in the server's database.

At the end of the feedback process, the HTTP server receives the feedback data and data extracted from the URL, which contains meetingId and userId, and will be used to find their corresponding records in the server's database.

## Running with docker-compose

    docker-compose up

Changes the docker-compose.yml to fit your use case. **Note:** Ensure there are no spaces between the variable name and the equals sign (e.g., `VAR=value`, not `VAR = value`).

    FEEDBACK_URL (optional)
      Where to submit the feedback object. With no URL results will be exclusivelly logged

    SHARED_SECRET
      Your server's shared secret used to register web hooks

    BASIC_URL
      Domain of your server without the /bigbluebutton/

    REDIRECT_URL (optional)
      Where to redirect user after the feedback form. Can also be set by `userdata-feedbackredirecturl` or `metadata_feedbackredirecturl`

    REDIRECT_TIMEOUT
      default: 10000

    LOG_LEVEL
      default: info
      valid values: error, debug, info, verbose

    LOG_STDOUT
      default: true

    PORT
      default: 3009

## Deploying to Production

### 1. Build and start the container

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

On first start, the container copies the built static assets into the host directory `/usr/share/bigbluebutton/feedback/`. This directory is bind-mounted via `docker-compose.yml` and will be served directly by nginx.

### 2. Configure nginx

Copy the `feedback.nginx` file from this repository to `/usr/share/bigbluebutton/nginx/feedback.nginx` on the BBB host, then reload nginx:

```bash
sudo cp feedback.nginx /usr/share/bigbluebutton/nginx/feedback.nginx
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Upgrading an existing install requires copying the file again: older versions
proxied the whole `/feedback` path to the back-end, which no longer serves the
static assets.

The nginx configuration serves static assets (HTML, JS, CSS) directly from disk and proxies only API endpoints to the back-end:

```nginx
location = /feedback/check   { proxy_pass http://localhost:3009; }
location = /feedback/submit  { proxy_pass http://localhost:3009; }
location = /feedback/webhook { proxy_pass http://localhost:3009; }

location /feedback {
  root /usr/share/bigbluebutton;
  try_files $uri /feedback/index.html;
}
```

### 3. Configure bbb-web

Configure `bbb-web` to redirect logged-out users to the feedback application after they leave the meeting.

The redirect URL should be `https://YOUR_BBB_HOST/feedback?userId=%%USERID%%&meetingId=%%MEETINGID%%`

* Edit `logoutURL` in `/usr/share/bbb-web/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties`
* Or create your meeting with `logoutURL`
* Or send it via `userdata-logoutURL`

## Customizing the feedback form

The form definition is shipped as a static JSON asset (not bundled into the app),
so it can be overridden per deployment without rebuilding. It is served from
`/usr/share/bigbluebutton/feedback/feedbackData.json` and fetched by the client at
runtime.

To customize the form on a host:

1. Edit `/usr/share/bigbluebutton/feedback/feedbackData.json`.
2. No rebuild or restart is required — the client fetches the file on next load.

The container **seeds** the default file only when it is missing, so your
customizations survive container restarts and image upgrades. To reset the form
back to the shipped default, delete the file and restart the container.

The whole form — steps, their order and their questions — is data. Step ids are
arbitrary: what a step *looks like* comes from its `type`, and where it *goes*
comes from the `next` of the option the user picks. Steps can be added, renamed or
removed without any code change.

```jsonc
{
  "initialStep": "rating",        // which step opens the form (default: "rating")

  "rating": {
    "type": "rating",             // star scale; stars = highest score listed
    "progress": "01/04",          // free-form label shown next to the title
    "1": { "next": "problem" },   // each score picks the step that follows it
    "5": { "next": "like" }
  },

  "problem": {
    "type": "options",            // radios and/or one free-text area
    "progress": "02/04",
    "titleLabel": { "id": "app.customFeedback.problem.title" },   // optional
    "options": [
      {
        "type": "radio",
        "textLabel": { "id": "my.audio.option", "defaultMessage": "Audio" },
        "next": "audioProblem",   // omit to end the form after this option
        "key": "problem",         // key/value recorded in the feedback payload
        "value": "audio"
      },
      {
        "type": "radio",
        "textLabel": { "id": "app.customFeedback.other" },
        "next": "email",
        "key": "problem",
        "value": "other"          // "other" is what pairs with the text area
      },
      {
        "type": "textArea",
        "key": "problem_described",
        "placeholderLabel": { "id": "app.customFeedback.describeProblem" },  // optional
        "next": "email"           // where typed free text goes; without it the form closes
      }
    ]
  },

  "email": {
    "type": "email",              // e-mail input; lands in the payload as user.email
    "progress": "04/04",
    "options": [
      { "type": "email", "key": "user.email",
        "placeholderLabel": { "id": "app.customFeedback.email.placeholder" } }
    ]
  }
}
```

Step `type` values are `rating`, `options` and `email` — a new *kind of input*
(anything none of the three can render) is the only change that still needs code.
`confirmation` is reserved for the closing step, and any step that is reached but
not described in the file simply ends the form.

Typing free text follows the text area's own `next`, not the one on the `other`
radio it pairs with, so point both at the same step unless writing an answer is
meant to end the form earlier.

Labels are message ids resolved against the locale files, so adding a key under
`/usr/share/bigbluebutton/feedback/locales/` (see the section below) translates a
custom label. A label may also carry a `defaultMessage`, which is used when no
locale provides that id — handy for a one-off option you do not want to translate.

Consult the shipped form for the full structure: [feedbackData.json](frontend/public/feedbackData.json).

## Customizing translations

Locales are shipped as static JSON assets (not bundled into the app), so they can
be overridden per deployment without rebuilding. They are served from
`/usr/share/bigbluebutton/feedback/locales/<locale>.json` (e.g. `en.json`,
`es.json`, `pt_BR.json`, `it.json`) and fetched by the client at runtime.

To override a translation on a host:

1. Edit the desired file under `/usr/share/bigbluebutton/feedback/locales/`, or add
   a new `<locale>.json` (e.g. `es_MX.json`).
2. No rebuild or restart is required — the client fetches the file on next load.

The container **seeds** the default locale files only when they are missing, so
your overrides survive container restarts and image upgrades. To reset a locale
back to the shipped default, delete its file and restart the container.

The client resolves the file to load from the browser/URL `locale`, falling back
to the language default (e.g. `pt` -> `pt_BR`) and then to `en`. Missing keys in a
translation fall back to English.
